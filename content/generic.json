My previous work experience and education has allowed me to develop strong communication and organizational skills which are so often required in fast-paced environments.</p><p>My academic and personal portfolios span multiple technologies and industries. From websites to research, health informatics to geographic imaging, nothing is really &apos;off the table&apos; for what I&apos;m interested in. I like to remain somewhat technology-agnostic; as a proactive self-starter I&apos;m open to learning new technologies and adapting to them quickly.</p>"
